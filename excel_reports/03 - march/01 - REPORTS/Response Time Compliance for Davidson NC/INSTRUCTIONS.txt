Turn Out Time = Enroute – Dispatch Notified
Travel Time = Arrival – Enroute
Total Time = Arrival – Dispatch Notified

1st Arriving Unit’s time compliance is 00:06:20
After 1st unit, time compliance is  00:08:20

Criteria I used for the Report:

Dispatch Notified is after 1/1/2023 AND
Incident Report Status is equal to Authorized AND
Apparatus Arrival Time is not null


I overwrote the saved file several times as I made additional changes.  Total rows of raw data should be 268 at the time of running.
